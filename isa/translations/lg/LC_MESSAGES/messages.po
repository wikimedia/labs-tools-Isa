msgid "Structured data is data with a high degree of structured organization."

msgstr ""

#: templates/main/help.html:93

msgstr ""

#: templates/main/help.html:104

#: templates/main/help.html:107
msgid "Captions are available as part of our structured data, while descriptions are not."
msgstr ""

#: templates/main/help.html:108
msgid "In technical terms, a description is plain wikitext wrapped in a language template, wrapped again in an Information template; while captions are Wikibase labels."
msgstr ""

#: templates/main/help.html:111
msgid "As such, captions will be searchable through the API, making it easy to find/filter/pull captions from files as metadata."
msgstr ""

#: templates/main/help.html:112
